Ph.D. candidate @BigCaT_UM (the Bioinformatics department at Maastricht University).

I'm currently learning about linked data approaches to improve knowledge represdentation and integration in the domain of nanomaterial safety.
Also, working at the moment on trying to make retracted papers a bit easier to access, [retractable](github.com/jmillanacosta/retractable).

Looking to collaborate on open science projects!
